Kilde — is a free template for an independent media crafted by [essens](https://essens.cc). It was created to help building human-scale indy web landscape. With that said, this template is for independent makers, writers, podcasters, journalists, students, NGOs, and small media.

The template is a great starter both for seasoned [Astro](https://astro.build/) developers, as well as for those new to the whole web development space. Feel free to tweak and change it.

If you are planning to use this template for building a commercial media of any nature — a zine, podcasting website, and whatnot — consider [saying "thank you"](https://essens.cc/thank-you) to [essens](https://essens.cc/manifest).

Consider leaving the "created by" at the bottom. It's not necessary. After all, no one can find out if you were to remove it. But you could help nurturing the indy web landscape. Also, by leaving it, you help spreading the word about [essens](https://essens.cc/), and sharing the free stuff built by the studio.

Good luck!
